This is a Learning-Project named 'trave-site'
#
it is created by doing the udemy.com course:
#
GIT-a Web-Developer Job: Mastering the modern workflow
#
taught by Web  Developer Brad Schiff
#
in the middle of the project I started automated security-fixes by git, 
relying on git-security-alerts, depending on old dependencies versions like jQuery ans so on...
#
after this parts of the project didn't work anymore, 
#
so e.g. the icons desapeared after the automated created icons-sprite-file
#
to fix this, I started a 2nd-version and am going to finish the project, 
working on this branch as the default branch!
